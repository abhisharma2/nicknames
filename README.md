### Nicknames

## Introduction

Nicknames is a Google Chrome web extension that finds and replaces folks real names with
their well known alter-ego "nicknames". This project started as a place for NBA player nicknames
but has grown to include all categories on the insistence from others.


## Contributing

Feel free to contribute nicknames as a PR. All data is sitting inside a JSON file
in the `data` folder.

Nicknames will be approved or rejected by the committee of 5 (Joel, Rishad, Scott, Chris and me).

Visit [Nickname's official page](http://abhiously.com/nicknames) for more details

This is a fun project and by no means is it intended to hurt or offend anyone
